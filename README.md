# Investigation of UAV Detection in Images with Complex Backgrounds and Rainy Artifacts

This repository contains the code and resources for detecting Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in images with complex backgrounds and rainy artifacts. We have implemented and evaluated four state-of-the-art (SOTA) object detection models:

1. **Faster-RCNN**
2. **RetinaNet**
3. **YOLOv5**
4. **YOLOv8**

The repository includes pre-trained weights for each model and a dataset for training and evaluation.
